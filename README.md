# Sequential_Proposal_MCMC
In this notebook we will analyze the work of Joonha Park and Yves Atchadé in the article Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms with sequential proposals., published online on the 24th June 2020 (part of Springer Nature 2020).  Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods are usually used to sample from a probability distribution. In the following, we consider the objective of obtaining samples from a target distribution  π  on a measurable space  (X,X) , we assume that  π  has a density with respect to a reference measure denoted by  λ  (we also denote by  π  this density).
